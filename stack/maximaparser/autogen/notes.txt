DO NOT EDIT THE FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY BY HAND!

This directory contains autogenerated files, such as the PEG.js autogenerated PHP files.

Note that the PEG.js definition is currently part of the Stateful project.

Also there are two very similar versions of the generated parser, one using mbstring and one that does not.
As some installations of Moodle might not have mbstring we need to deal with that, however the non mbstring
version will not work quite the same the obvious difference being the lack of support for some unicode characters
in some places.
