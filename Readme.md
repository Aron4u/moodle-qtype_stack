# STACK 4.3 (beta)

[STACK](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/index.md) is an assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines.

STACK was created by [Chris Sangwin](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/) of the University of Edinburgh, and includes the work of many [other contributors](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md). A demonstration server is available in Edinburgh:  [https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo](https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo).

STACK is based on continuing research and use at the University of Edinburgh, the Open University, Aalto, Loughborough University, the University of Birmingham and others.

## Current state of development

STACK 4.3 contains some important re-engineering of core components.  This will enable significant new features in future releases.
