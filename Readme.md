# abacus branch of STACK (ALPHA)

[STACK](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/index.md)
is an open-source system for computer-aided assessment in Mathematics and related
disciplines, with emphasis on formative assessment.

STACK was created by Chris Sangwin of Lteh University of Edinburgh, and includes the work of
[other contributors](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/blob/master/doc/en/About/Credits.md).
Notably, this branch contains significant contributions by Matt Harulja of Aalto, Finland.

## Current state of development

This branch of the code contains some major changes from the previous versions, notably the question blocks from Aalto Finland.
Originally intended as "STACK 3.4", these changes are significant enough for this to scheduled as "STACK 4.0".
