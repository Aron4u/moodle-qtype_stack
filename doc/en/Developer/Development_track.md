How to report bugs and make suggestions is described on the [community](../About/Community.md) page.

## STACK custom reports

Basic reports now work.

* *done* Add titles and explanations to the page, and document with examples.
* Really ensure "attempts" list those with meaningful histories.  I.e. if possible filter out navigation to and from the page etc.
* Add better maxima support functions for off-line analysis.
 * A fully maxima-based representation of the PRT?
