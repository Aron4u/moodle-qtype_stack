# Development track for STACK

Requests for features and ideas for developing STACK are all recorded in [Future plans](Future_plans.md). The
past development history is documented on [Development history](Development_history.md).

How to report bugs and make suggestions is described on the [community](../About/Community.md) page.

## Version 4.3

Version 4.3 represents a major internal re-engineering of STACK, with a new dedicated parser and an updated mechanism for connecting to Maxima.  This is a significant improvement, refactoring some of the oldest code and unblocking progress to a wide range of requested features.

CHANGES:

* In the forbidden words we now match whole words not substrings.
* Removed the RegExp answer test.
* Removed the Maxima MathML code (which wasn't connected or used).
* Add in extra option `simp` to inputs.
* Add in extra option `align` to inputs.
* Add in extra options `allowempty` and `hideanswer` to inputs.

TODO:

* Add in the autocomplete input type.
* Add in the resizable matrix input type.
* Better CSS, including "tool tips".  May need to refactor JavaScript.  (See issue #380)


## Other things to fix

1. Matrix instant validation does not appear to work.

## Version 4.4

* Refactor DB of 'insterStars' and remove stack_input_factory::convert_legacy_insert_stars.  Really use new values throughout.  See [Future plans for syntax of answers and STACK](Syntax_Future.md)
* 1st version of API.
* Better install code (see #332).
* A STACK Maxima function which returns the number of decimal places/significant figures in a variable (useful when providing feedback).  Needed for the refactoring.
* Enable individual questions to load Maxima libraries.  (See issue #305)
* Add support for matrices with floating point entries, and testing numerical accuracy.
* Update MCQ to accept units.
* Add a base N check to the numeric input.
* Expand support for input validation options to matrices (e.g. floatnum, rationalize etc.)
* Refactor numerical answer tests to make proper use of ast
* Move find_units_synonyms into the parser more fully?
