# Statistics support in STACK.

By default STACK loads two optional packages into Maxima to provide statistics support:

    load("distrib");
    load (descriptive);

Please see Maxima's documentation for information on the functions these packages contain.


## Package: descriptive

Note that the "descriptive" package includes a number of functions to plotting graphs, such as boxplots and scatterplot.  These are not supported by STACK.
