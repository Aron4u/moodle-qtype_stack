# Hints

STACK has a system for "hints".  These are common mathematical facts and formulae, which might appear on a "formula sheet".  It is not sensible for a teacher who wants to include then to repeatedly type them in.

These can be placed anywhere in the CASText.  The current syntax is `[[hint:key]]` where `key` is one of the keys listed below.  For example to include the laws of indices type `[[hint:alg_indices]]` in your CASText.
