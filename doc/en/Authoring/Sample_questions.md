The sample questions are in English.

There are two sets of sample materials

We would encourage colleagues to release their materials under a creative commons licence.  Please contact the developers.

The FETLAR project released a large collection of STACK 2 questions in English covering calculus and algebra in April 2010.

* Questions to cover all parts of the [The Map of Algebraic Manipulation](http://www.mth.kcl.ac.uk/staff/ad_barnard/Pocket.pdf).
* Questions to cover all of the [Calculus Refresher](http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk/resources/exercisebooks/mathcentre/final0502-calc-ref-ukmlsc.pdf) by Dr Tony Croft and Dr Anthony Kay.

These have been converted into STACK 3 format and are included in the demo course.
